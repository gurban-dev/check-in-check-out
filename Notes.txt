cd check-in-check-out

Create a Django project for the backend/server-side of the
application:
django-admin startproject backend

Django is a high-level Python web framework that helps developers
build secure, scalable, and maintainable web applications quickly.
It provides all the essential tools like handling URLs, working
with databases, and managing user authentication so you can focus
on your app's features instead of reinventing the wheel.

Create a virtual environment folder inside the root folder
of the Django project:
python3 -m venv .venv

Windows OS:
python -m venv .venv

A virtual environment prevents version conflicts.
Your computer may have a different version of Python than the
one used in your Django project. Having an isolated environment
prevents these two different versions of Python from clashing.

The . that precedes "venv" indicates that the virtual environment
folder will be hidden which ensures that it is not pushed to a
GitHub repository.

Activate the virtual environment in Windows OS:
venv\Scripts\activate
