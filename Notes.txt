Initialising a Git repository:
git init

Add all files in the current directory that should be included in
the next commit:
git add .

Create the commit with an attached message:
git commit -m "attached_message"

Rename the current Git branch to main, using the -M flag to force
the rename if necessary:
git branch -M main

Add a remote repository to your local Git project:
git remote add origin <remote_repository_URL>

origin is the name you assign to the remote (a common default name).

<repository_URL> is the URL of the remote GitHub repository.

Push the local main branch to the remote repository (origin) and
set it as the default upstream branch:
git push -u origin main


Techsmart is the platform used by a teacher at her school to
teach kids.

This platform was purchased by the district.

The teacher thinks that Visual Studio Code will be able to be
used on a school computer.


Model Breakdown:
1. Student Model

Stores basic student info (ID, name, grade)
Tracks cumulative prayer time in total_prayer_time_minutes
Automatically updates when visits are completed
Methods to get formatted time displays

2. BellSchedule Model

Stores class periods for each day of the week
Supports different schedules for different days (Mon-Fri)
Key method: get_current_period() - automatically determines if
            student left during class
Can define multiple periods per day (Period 1, Period 2, Lunch, etc.)

In middle school, Monday and Friday have the same schedule.

3. Visit Model (replaces Departure)
This is the core tracking model with:
Student Information Fields:

first_name, last_name - captured at check-in
student_id_at_visit - ID at time of visit
Foreign key to Student model

Time Tracking Fields:

left_classroom_at - Student manually enters this
checked_in_at - Auto-recorded when they arrive at prayer room
checked_out_at - Auto-recorded when they leave prayer room

Calculated Duration Fields:

transit_time_minutes - Travel time (classroom → prayer room)
prayer_duration_minutes - Time in prayer room (for admin reports)
total_absence_minutes - Total time gone from class

Bell Schedule Integration:

period_when_left - Which class period they left during
check_if_student_arrived_during_first_fifteen_minutes - Boolean flag
if the student checks in during the first fifteen minutes of a
class.

check_if_student_left_during_first_fifteen_minutes - Boolean flag
if the student checks out during the first fifteen minutes of a
class.

The student can leave during the class so long as they have
a green hall pass.

Checks out at 1 PM, but checked in the office at 1:30 PM.
Calculate how many minutes between the time they left the
classroom and the time they checked in, in the office.

Compte the total time they were outside of the classroom.
